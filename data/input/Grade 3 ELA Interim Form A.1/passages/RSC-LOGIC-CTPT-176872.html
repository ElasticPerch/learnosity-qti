    <p style="text-align: center;">Government is for Kids</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>by</em> Mike Weinstein</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The government is the group of people that makes laws and
    enforces them. It also provides services for its citizens. In the United States, some of the
    people in the government are elected, a few are appointed, and most are hired. The federal
    government is the group that makes and enforces laws for the whole country. It is based in
    Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.</strong></p>

    <p>1 &amp;nbsp; You know what? You are lucky to be reading this! In the early 1900s, many
    American kids worked eight or more hours a day, six days a week. They couldn't go to
    school.</p>

    <p>2 &amp;nbsp;But some adults said that education is important. They thought all children
    should go to school. The federal government in Washington, D.C., agreed. It made full-time work
    by young children illegal, or against the law.</p>

    <p>3 &amp;nbsp; Most people don't spend much time thinking about the federal government. After
    all, most of you don't often see government workers in your school or in your town. But the
    federal government is a powerful force in our country. When it makes rules, the whole country
    must obey them.</p>

    <p>4 &amp;nbsp; The government's work extends far beyond Washington, in ways that might
    surprise you.</p>

    <p>5 &amp;nbsp; Ever ride in a car? Of course you do! The government builds and maintains many
    highways and bridges. It makes laws about the safety of cars.</p>

    <p>6 &amp;nbsp; Safety, in fact, is an important part of the government's work. For example, it
    makes sure that your toys are safe. Recently, some electric cars and trucks that kids can ride
    were catching on fire. The government found out about the fires and recalled the toys. (A
    recall means that the toy maker must fix the problem if customers return the toy to be
    fixed.)&amp;nbsp;</p>

    <p>7 &amp;nbsp; Delivering the mail is one of the government's most important jobs. The United
    States Postal Service brings you postcards from traveling friends and takes your thank-you
    notes to Grandma. Post offices are found in the biggest cities and the smallest villages. Every
    time you drop an envelope in that blue mailbox, you are using a government service.</p>

    <p>8 &amp;nbsp; Have you ever gone camping in a national park? Thank your federal government
    for making the campsite available. Did you watch Sesame Street when you were younger? Money
    from the government helped to pay for that program and the public broadcasting system that
    showed it.</p>

    <p>&amp;nbsp;9 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Washington, D.C., may be far away from your home and school.
    Even so, the federal government touches you almost every day of your life.</p>
